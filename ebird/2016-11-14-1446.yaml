#  -- Pair of Surf Scoters continue at Setenity Pond near the Heard Museum.  They ate swimming amongst a small flock of Gafwalls.  About the same size as the Gafwalls with brownish color and large thick bill.  One appears to be 1st winter.  The other has white marking near the eye and at the base of the bill.  When they roll flanks are white.  Just started diving.  Add pic later.
- Great Egret
