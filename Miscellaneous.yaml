# We need to select the country.
# For ease of use, I'll use the United States.
- country: United States

# If you've chosen the United States, then you should
# also specify the state. Texas for example
- state: Texas

# The specs that will change most often are the location and date.
# Typically what I do is enter the location and then change the date
# whenever I have a new entry.

# You can use 6 letter codes or the full name.
# If you enter the full name, enter one per line, start with the dash.
# Same thing if you have one 6 letter code.

# If you have multiple codes, start with "- codes:"

# The file is processed sequentially. So, for example, if you add a
# state line at the end, then every sighting after that refers to that
# state; it doesn't affect the sightings that come before that line.

# That's mostly it. My repo has a number of good examples on this.
